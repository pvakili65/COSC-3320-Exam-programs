For any height h, build a perfect binary tree (completely full at every level) and delete any leaf node.
Why This Works
In a perfect binary tree of height h:

Every internal node has exactly two children
Every leaf is at the same depth
Every node has a balance factor of 0 (left and right subtrees have equal height)

When you delete a leaf x:

The leaf is simply removed (no successor/predecessor complications)
Its parent's balance factor changes from 0 to ±1
A balance factor of ±1 is still valid for AVL trees—no rotation needed
The parent's height doesn't change (its other subtree still has the same height)
Since the parent's height is unchanged, no ancestors are affected
