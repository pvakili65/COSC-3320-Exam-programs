Consider the following function, CheckProds(A,B,C) where A is 2D array of size (1:n, 1:n), n a positive integer. 
The body of CheckProds implements the following computations
B[i] = A[i,1]*A[i,2]*...*A[i,n]
C[i] = A[1,i]*A[2,i]*...*A[n,i]
A) Give the complete function, CheckProds(A,B,C), including in particular the code of the function body
    and the method of passing the three parameters
B) Determine for your function its time and space complexity (Space complexity is the amount of space of memory required by the function
    in addition to the space for the actual parameters)

Solution(write everything down):
A)
//Pass all parameters by reference to save space and time
//assume all elements are integers
void CheckProds(A,B,C){
    int B'[n];
    int C'[n];
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        B'[i]=1; //dont write these 2 comments down
        C'[i]=1; //if it is addition, initialize to 0 instead
        for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
            B'[i]=B'[i]*A[i,j];
            C'[i]=C'[i]*A[j,i];
        }
    }
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        B[i]=B'[i];
        C[i]=C'[i];
    }
}

B)There are 2 1D arrays the get allocated in this function which makes the space complexity O(n)
    There is an embedded for loop (a for loop inside a for loop) each performing n iterations, which makes the 
    time complexity O(n^2)
